libfvde is a library to access FileVault Drive Encryption (FVDE) (or FileVault2) encrypted volumes.

The FVDE format is used by Mac OS X, as of Lion (10.7), to encrypt data on a storage media volume.

Project information:

* Status: experimental
* Licence: LGPLv3+

Supported Core Storage / FileVault2 implementations:

* Mac OS X Lion (10.7)
* Mac OS X Mountain Lion (10.8)
* Mac OS X Mavericks (10.9)
* Mac OS X Yosemite (10.10)
* Mac OS X El Capitan (10.11)
* macOS Sierra (10.12)
* macOS High Sierra (10.13)
* macOS Mojave (10.14)
* macOS Catalina (10.15)

Supported encryption volume types:

* removable media volume - with encrypted context (initial support as of 20121113 version)
* system volume
* multiple logical volumes

Supported protection methods:

* password
* recovery password
* VMK key data (as of 20121114 version)

Unsupported Core Storage format features:

* multiple physical volumes

Work in progress:

* DEFLATE compressed XML plist
* removable media volume - without encrypted context
* removable media volume - decrypted
* extend CoreStorage volume support
* partial encrypted volumes

Planned:

* Dokan support
