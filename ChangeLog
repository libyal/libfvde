TODO
* Make sure to detect PassphraseWrappedKEKStruct in different locations within
  the XML
* add password keep
* remove deprecated function
  - libfvde_volume_read_random
* double check 0x0505 findings with debug logs
* git version
  - make sure dependent local libs are in git
  - fix synclibs.sh for libfvalue Makefile.am
* merge reading metadata and encrypted metadata ?
* logical volume size: get from com.apple.corestorage.lv.size instead of
  first 0x001d or 0x0505 block? or compare values?

* API add volume identifier functions
* complete libfvde_xml_plist

* add handling of FVDE volumes with corrupt metadata, e.g. file header

* read and compare second physical volume header

* complete msvscpp build
  - add libxml2 support

* move initialize of volume specific runtime data to open and clean up to close
* store passwords as hashes?
* libxml
  integrate into packaging system
  print status info in configure
* split off AES KEK functions
* fvdemount add osxmount support
* code clean up
  - check for leading spaces
  - check for () without spaces
  - check for = alignment
  - check for if ( instead of if(
  - check error codes
* check README files
  - make sure pkg-config and libxml2 are mentioned as dependencies
* add debug output
  - encryption method
  - checksum algorithm

Future considerations:
* how does tie into CS volume management
  - rename library to libvcs ?
  - rename FileVault to CoreStorage ?
